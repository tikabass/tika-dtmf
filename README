DTMF-Decoder library.

Single include file DTMF decoding library for x86 computers.

This librarey provides stable and dependable DTMF detection for embedded applications.  Requires c++71+.

Features:
    - Sensitivity: -27dB
    - Min SnR ratio 3dB
    -Tailored for compatibility with ITU Q.24 Specification (https://www.itu.int/rec/dologin_pub.asp?lang=e&id=T-REC-Q.24-198811-I!!PDF-E&type=items)
    - High troughput, lazy algorithm for minimal CPU usage.
    - AVX2, FMA3, SSE4.1 and SSE2 hardware acceleration, selectable at compile-time.
    - Code does not allocate memory, and does not raise exceptions.
    - Small memory footprint (768 bytes per channel).
    - OS agnostic.
